  Estne, quaeso, inquam, sitienti in bibendo voluptas? Iam in altera

Arguably the greatest economist of his time, Ricardo was born in
London near the current Liverpool Street Station in 1772, the third
of six sons in a family that would number fifteen grown children.
His father was a Sephardic Jew from Portugal who had settled in
England after a spell in Holland. Ricardo followed his father into the
City where he made a fortune (worth over £100 million in today’s
money), principally by speculating on government debt. After
betting on the right outcome in the Battle of Waterloo (allegedly on
false information), he retired an extremely wealthy man to his
Gloucestershire estate where he pursued an interest in political
economy that had originally been prompted by his reading The
Wealth of Nations at the turn of the century.
David Ricardo’s writings on political economy were slightly less
ambitious than Smith’s (in that he didn’t aspire to the full science of
man), but his ideas have been just as influential. Ricardo advanced
key elements of Smith’s work by making at least two stunning
contributions to economic thought. First, he put forward a
compelling and original case for free trade through the theory of
comparative advantage, which would become a central tenet of
economic liberalism. And second, he formalised the labour theory of
value, which would become a cornerstone of Marxism
