Arguably the greatest economist of his time, Ricardo was born in
London near the current Liverpool Street Station in 1772, the third
of six sons in a family that would number fifteen grown children.
His father was a Sephardic Jew from Portugal who had settled in
England after a spell in Holland. Ricardo followed his father into the
City where he made a fortune (worth over £100 million in today’s
money), principally by speculating on government debt. After
betting on the right outcome in the Battle of Waterloo (allegedly on
false information), he retired an extremely wealthy man to his
Gloucestershire estate where he pursued an interest in political
economy that had originally been prompted by his reading The
Wealth of Nations at the turn of the century.

David Ricardo’s writings on political economy were slightly less
ambitious than Smith’s (in that he didn’t aspire to the full science of
man), but his ideas have been just as influential. Ricardo advanced
key elements of Smith’s work by making at least two stunning
contributions to economic thought. First, he put forward a
compelling and original case for free trade through the theory of
comparative advantage, which would become a central tenet of
economic liberalism. And second, he formalised the labour theory of
value, which would become a cornerstone of Marxism

In 1815 a controversy arose in England over the proposed Corn
Laws, which were designed to regulate the import and export of
grain, and in the process protect the economic interests of domesticlandlords. The prospect of tariffs on wheat imports and the resulting
higher domestic prices on grain prompted Ricardo to publish his
influential Essay on the Influence of a Low Price of Corn on the
Profits of Stock (1815). In it, he argued that raising tariffs on grain
imports would increase the rents of landlords, decrease the profits
of manufacturers and slow economic growth.

Ricardo’s opposition was part of a more general aversion to
mercantilism that he shared with Adam Smith. Smith had
recognised that trade was a two-way exchange, and that imports
could help countries increase exports and boost economic growth.
Consumers, Smith argued in The Wealth of Nations, should buy
products from where they were cheapest. All protection did was
create monopolies, which were ‘a great enemy to good
management’.

Ricardo took Smith’s ideas further. First, he articulated what
came to be known as the ‘law of diminishing marginal returns’, one
of the most important in economics. It holds that as more and more
resources are combined in production with a fixed resource – for
example, as more labour and machinery are used on a fixed parcel
of land – the incremental increase in output will diminish.
Restricting foreign imports would bring more marginal land into
production, raising grain prices, increasing rents to landlords,
reducing the profits of manufacturers and, as a consequence, lessen
their capacity to invest in new production. As we shall see in the
next chapter, the analogue on the demand side is diminishing
marginal utility, which holds that the more of a good one consumes
– such as ice cream on a sunny day – the less the enjoyment derived
from each additional scoop.

Ricardo’s main argument against the Corn Laws specifically and
mercantilism in general was based on his formulation of what
became known as the law of comparative advantage (which he
originally called ‘comparative costs’). He showed that even if one
country was absolutely superior to another in the production of all
goods there could still be gains from trade based on differences in
the relative efficiency of production between them. These gainsarise from each country specialising in producing the good for
which its comparative (domestic) cost is lower. It is better for the
country to exchange on more advantageous terms with its trading
partner than within its own economy with its own labour. As the
great Paul Samuelson once quipped, ‘comparative advantage is one
of the few things in economics that is true, but not obvious’. The
Appendix to this book details this non-obvious truth.
